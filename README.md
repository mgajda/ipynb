JuPyTer notebook parser
=======================
[JuPyTer](https://jupyter.org/) was formerly called IPython notebook.

It is cross-language interactive data science platform
that allows for interactive editing of code and visualizing its results.

This library allows to directly parse `.ipynb` files, and process them.

There is an example script `jupyter-extract` that just extracts
all the source code cells, and prints them.

Initial version was generated with [`json-autotype`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/json-autotype)
